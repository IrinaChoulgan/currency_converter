Currency Converter

This is a small application for converting currencies. The header displays the current date and the current
exchange rate of the dollar and euro against the hryvnia (according to the current date). Next, there are two
inputs for entering the number of currencies and a select for selecting currencies from the list provided. The
conversion takes place in both directions.

The app is built with React js.
